Most users of the software will NOT need to run code in this directory.  This
code is used to generate the training database and train the model.  However,
the git repository includes the trained model.  Nevertheless, this code is
included for reference.

The training database is generated in the directoy generate_training_database.
This database is used to train an ML model in the directory ml.  The code in
generate_training_database should be executed before the code in ml.
