# Pocket Finder Code
This code finds the locations of possible cryptic pockets within MD trajectories.

### Usage
The code is designed to be accessed through the function `predict_pockets`.  See
`run_model/run_predict_pockets.py` for an example.

The directory `train_model` includes the code that was used to train the ML model.  It
is expected that most software users will not need to run the code in this directory.
